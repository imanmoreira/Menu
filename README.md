## List of Goals

### Task 0:

The Navigation Bar should be up and running but it's having a weird bug... for some reason when you click the button it isn't doing anything. Can you look into how to make sure the list opens properly?

### Task 1:

Hmm, I'm not a big fan of the color on the menu. Could you pick another color to change it to?

### Task 2:

Users should be able to navigate back to the main page but right now they can't. Could you add a button to the Navigation bar that directs them back to the home page?

### Task 3:

Right now employees can add menu items correctly but the menu will only close when they add an item... can you add a button for them to close out of the popup?

### Task 4:

Right now when users are selecting items with the checkboxes, they aren't actually being selected properly... We want the users to be able to select specific menu items. The items should be added to the state so customers will be able to place an order after! This will also allow employees to delete certain items off the menu!

### Task 5:

It seems like our delete button for employees isn't working! When items are selected, the delete button shows up but it isn't doing anything. Can you look into how that can be fixed?

### Task 6:

We want users to be able to place orders after selecting items and for it to be stored in redux. Can you add a button for placing orders and create a redux action for placing orders?

### Task 7:

Can you create a page for the customers to view the orders they've placed?
