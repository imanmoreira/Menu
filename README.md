## List of Goals

### Task 1:

The Navigation Bar should be up and running but it's having a weird bug... for some reason when you click the button it isn't doing anything. Can you look into how to make sure the list opens properly?

### Task 2:

Users should be able to navigate back to the main page but right now they can't. Could you add a button to the Navigation bar that directs them back to the home page?

### Task

Right now

### Task 3:

Right now when users are selecting items with the checkboxes, they aren't actually being selected properly... We want the users to be able to select specific menu items. The items should be added to the state so customers will be able to place an order after! This will also allow employees to delete certain items off the menu!

### Task 4:

It seems like our delete button isn't working! When items are selected, the delete button shows up but it isn't doing anything. Can you look into how that can be fixed?
